      I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.gvsu.edu" target="_blank">Grand Valley State University</a> and trying to pursue a research career with 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.gvsu.edu/wri/" target="_blank">AWRI</a> after completing three awesome software development co-ops at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://viastore.com" target="_blank">Viastore</a>.

    <p>
      As a computer/environmental engineer, I enjoy working on solutions to environmental problems &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably snowboarding, cruising around on my penny board,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
